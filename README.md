**Project for Scientific Python (SS2021)**

*by Alina Krause, Paula Heigl and Pia Schr√∂ter*

The program creates a personalised kaleidoscope based on fractal curves (Koch Snowflake).

**Attributes of the kaleidoscope**

The user will be asked a series of questions to determine the attributes of the kaleidoscope.

*Complexity*

The user can decide how many "Snowflakes" the kaleidoscope should (i.e. the depth).

*Colour*

The user can choose between 7 colours (red, yellow, green, grey, blue, purple and multicoloured).

*Rotation*

The user can decide if the kaleidoscope can rotate or not.

*Speed*

Finally, the user can choose how fast the kaleidoscope should change.
